            <h1>My name is Ryan Liban</h1>
            <p>I am from Milwaukee, Wisconsin; born and raised. I always loved technology and in high school was big into art. Because of this, I decided to go to art school while working at Best Buy. I graduated from college in 2007 with my BFA in Communication Design. After college, I got a job at Wynn Las Vegas as a Graphic Designer. After getting my fill of Las Vegas, I decided I wanted to move back home. I am currently a Senior Designer/Art Director at Potawatomi Hotel & Casino in Milwaukee, WI. I have grown very interested in the tech world and coding over the past few years. I have dabbled, but never felt I was making any meaningful gains. I took the plunge with Bloc with hopes of broadening my skills to launch my own freelance business.</p>
